CSS

    Cascading Style Sheets
        -doesnt deal with the data content
        -define how the elements display
    Some common styles
        -text: font, size, bold, italic, underline
        -paragraph: margin, border, padding, justification (left, right, center, justify)
    Styles can be defined:
        -as a sstyle attribute on an HTML element
        -within the <style> tag in the <head> section
        -in a linked external file
            <link href="css/cv.css" rel="stylesheet">
            make a file in another folder in this case its css folder, cv.css file.
    When style conflicts, the most specific style applies.
        -hard to find what style sheet is causing problems.

Syntax
    -defining styles requires referencing the style itself followed by a colon,
        then value, typically in quotes.
    -stylename: "value";

        color: red;
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        border: 1px solid silver;

Magnitudes (sizes)
    -when specifying a size, requies the magnitude of the number.
    -examples: 
        Points (pt): for text (1/72in)
        Pixels (px): a single dot on a screen
        Relative measure (em): relative to the default font size.
            .5 em will take a 50pt down to 25pt font. Depending on default
            This way all font will be relatively the same.

Single HTML statement
    Could use <span id="lastname" class="peraonal">Scott </span><br>
    Then in <head> tags, put <style> #lastname {color: red; font-weight: bold;}

    class is how you put the style on a bunch of statements, but id can be used for that particular one in the class.
    like a primary key for the HTML statement. Best way for one statement.
        -Id is unique per page.

    You can also add a new variable, like putting;
        .bold {font-weight: bold; }
    then <span class="personal bold">Josh</span>. 
        -applies multiple to the name.

Multiple stylesheets will load with the last one loaded being used.
    -1st company standard
    -2nd division
    -3rd is your sheet that all change paragraphs.  This one will win, loaded last.

Colors
    -Name: red, blue, green, chartreuse,...
    -RGB: rgb(0-255, 0-255, 0-255)
    -RGBA: rgba (0-255, 0-255, 0-255, 0.0-1.0)
        Opacity is 0.0 (transparent)
    -By Hex (most common)
        #FF0000 (red), #00FF00 (green), #0000FF (blue)

Fonts
    -there are many facets to fonts:
        -font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Tahoma (be sure to test if the fonts are not available what it looks like)
        -font-size: 12pt, 16pt, 24pt
        -font-weight: bold, bolder, 400, 600
        -font-style: italic
        -font-variant: small-caps

    Font-Family
        -Declares the font to use: Arial, times new roman, courier new
        -can specify multiple fonts in cas a specified font is missing on users system
        -usually the last font is sans-serif

    Font-Size
        -the size of the text font usually in points(pt)
        -Normal pt size is 12pt (1pt = 1/72in)
        -May use px (24px) but not used often
                font-size: 12pt;
    
    Relative font size
        -It is better to specify font size in relative terms vs absolute
        -em or rem is relative to base font size (ex 1.5em = 1.5 times the base font size)
        -A percent is also used (125%)
            font-size: 1.2em;

    Font-Weight
        -bold or normal
        -there are other options you can look up but mostly just bold or normal

    Font-Style
        -Italic
        -again other options
    
    Abbrev font declaration
        -multiple styles can be defined on a single line
            font: italic small-caps bold
            12pt/14.4pt Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif.
            (default then / line height -typically 20% higher = 14.4pt.)
            (saying want Tahoma, if not there then Arial, if not there some sans-serif font)
        basicially,
            font: normal normal normal  unless you want bold font: normal normal bold
            12pt/14.4pt Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif.

        example:  body {
                        font: normal normal normal 16pt/19.8pt Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif }
    
    sets the default for the entire body section.

    Margin, Border, Padding
        -Relates to geometry around the contents of an HTML element
        -The contents of HTMl element has a dimension
        -Padding the distance from contents to the border
        -Margin is the distance from the border to the closest HTLM element.

Open your webpage and hit f12, look at style and the square boxes
margin 
    border
        padding
You can click on the - sign and adjust them to different pixels.
updated page margin to 50px on each side.

--you can adjust everything here, add borders with colors and just see what it looks like 
without changing your code!!


    Margin & Padding
        -can define all four sides of the box
            --Top, Right, Bottom, Left
        -Examples:
            margin: 1px = all four sides
            padding: 1px 2px = top/bottom & right/left
            margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px =top, right, bottom, left (always in that order)

Style Selectors
    -selectors are identifiers that indicate which HTML element a style applies.
    -Three global selectors:
        tagname (p, div, span, etc)
        id attribute (id="..") (then have to use #name) #abc {color: red;}
        class attribute (class="..") use .name in css.  

Multiple Selectors
    -muliple can be defined for the same style
    -selectors must be separated by a comma
    -the following example applies the same style to all div tags, 
        the HTML with id="abc", and all HTML with class="xyz":
            div, #abc, .xyz {color: blue;}

    -put a comma between the selectors

    further example below shows you can do one thing with multiple selectors and then add to the one selector.
    .left, .right { width: 49%;} =both classes left & right will have this width.
    .right {text-align: right;} =on top of the width, right class will now align right.

    Can also have multiple classes, like if you set .red{color: red;} .bold{font-weight: bold;}
        you can say I want my paragraph to have both of those stylings.
            <p class="red bold">text here that is red & bold</p>

Child Selectors
    -selectors can apply to child HTML elements
    -selectors must be separated by a space
    -This example applies the style to all p tags that are within a div tag with an id="top":
            
            div#top p {border: 1px solid red;} 
                        //div tag with id of "top" and inside that div the paragraphs follow this.
                        //so all paragraphs in this div with id top have a red border now.

Defining Styles
    -Not recommended to put Style tag style="".
    -within the <style> tags inside of the <head> tags, but still not best.
    -within external file linked in to an HTML page with the <link> tag
            <link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet">


Side by Side <div>
    -for things like Pros & Cons that would show side by side.
    -block elements dont typically go side by side, but can do it with styling.

div {display: inline-block;} 
        
        -added border to tell the difference between them
        -width changed to 49% to be perfectly side by side.  If we do 50% then it overflows the 1px and goes back 
            to being top and bottom.
                
                div {
                    width: 49%;
                    display: inline-block;
                    border: 1px solid silver;
                    }
       
        -added a bunch of text on left and they were mismatched.
        -added vertical-align: top;

                    div {
                        min-height: 300px;
                        vertical-align: top;
                        width: 49%;
                        display: inline-block;
                        border: 1px solid silver;
                    }

    //Html
        <div class="sbs"> ... </div>
        <div class="sbs"> ... </div>
    //CSS
        div.sbs {...}

BOOTSTRAP

    getbootstrap.com
        top right check the version #.
        -if you modify someone elses code that used a different version, could be an issue.
        -if they used bootstrap.

    search buttons and it shows the typical buttons with colors. colors tied to the name.
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">text</button>
    
        Disabled state buttons for if someone is not a reviewer, it would be a little greyed out.

    searched table to review the table options in bootstrap.


1. You can download style sheets to your computer and use it that way, but its harder to upgrade.
2. you can put a link in to their website and use the internet.
