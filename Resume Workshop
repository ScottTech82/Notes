9/30  ===========================

Interviewing 
    when talking about ourselves have a reason for leaving statement.

    Never use word Believe or Think.  I hope to, or think I can.
    Talk with Skills I have, ready to launch into the arena and can do this!

    What do you feel you need more work on.
        While I have learned quite a bit, its only 3 months and feel I would like a deeper understanding.

    Tell me when you worked on more than 1 project at a time.
        when I managed I always worked on more than 1 project.
        I actually designed my own excel sheet where I tracked progress in each different project.
            I tracked Underwriting training, underwriter quality, meetings -what was discussed.

    Time when you were disappointed in your performance
        it would have to be when I was supervising and was so focused on the company
        and the success of the team that I worked long hours and some times would not see my kids over
        multiple days.  

        Being an end user having the ability to capture what the end user is seeing as a product.
        Now as a developer I need to be sure I am crafting it for the end user.

    Showed initiative and took the lead.
        When the company was asked to take on a complex program that has to work with an outside
        company to complete the program.  I took it on and felt we could execute it successfully while everyone else was hesitant.  I actually remember them saying wow, Josh just takes the bull by the horns. My team got the program and we did great.

    See yourself in 5 years
        Hopefully with your company, if you will have me, working on the team.  5 years sounds like a long time, but it comes around so fast.  During that time I will continue to grow and have a greater knowledge to be more of a mid level developer.

    What is one new technology that really excited you
        Meaning any tech.. C# is new to me.

    What are the tenants of OOP
        all 4 of them list out.
        Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
            AND Abstraction xxGreg says nope.
            Maybe composition but thats instead of Inheritance.

    What is Left Join in SQL
        -need to explain in detail.
        Only the data that matches the first table from the second table.
        picture each table is a circle and match up in the intersection.  Its the table on the left with 
        data that matches the table on the right.

    Salary Range?
        push the bull down the field.
        I really dont want to make this about money, I want to see if this is a good match.
        I am more concerned about longevity and staying with the company long term.
            or Max Grads are typically earning between thsi and this.
            Does that align with what you are seeing or offering?
    
    YOU MUST HAVE QUESTIONS TO ASK.


Ask them questions!!!!
    Someone took a job and it ended up being call center type processing tickets.
    asked about when coding and they said not for at least 2 years.  Kind of stuck now.
****
    Another one got the job because they asked the best questions!
****


    Power Message -highlight certain key words.  Going from this to this to this.
    Time yourself at 60 seconds in lenght.  Either shave or add things on .


Prep for common Interview Questions
    -tell me about yourself
    -What are your strenghts
    -whats your biggest weakness
    -why did you leave your last job
    -why should I hire you
    
    If you meet 70% of what they are asking for you should apply.
    If they have a program you havent learned
        I recently learned like 16 or 17 programs, learning '''whatever program'''
        wont be an issue, is there something you suggest I can start with or look at to 
        get a better feel before I start?

    --turn it around and ask questions.

    --Ask them how much they use certain programs.
    --if the pay is over 70k it might be a little over our heads. So watch out.

    --lack of experience, its ok to say you google things, or walk away and come back to it.

    Employers say the only difference between college 4 year degree and bootcamp is the projects.
        college grad has 4 or 5 projects in Portfolio, we only have capstone project in Portfolio.


    Meetups or Drinkups in local Cincy.
        another one where you get free tshirt, free pizza, and you code with them.

        Cincy software online that we should be following.
        .net group or java group.
        LinkedIn, start following 
                -Software Craftmanship
                        run by IT bigwig at Kroger.
                        Did his own self-learning, created a project and a company
                        adopted what he created.  Spent a lot of time on it while
                        doing another job. Michael Richardson, follow him!!!

****************
    HackerRank!!  Get star #1, take a screenshot and post on LinkedIn that you got the star.
        employers want to see it, translates to passion.

    Defer Talking about salary.
        -deferral strategy.. at this point I dont know enough about the major responsibility and performance goals of this position. I'm hesitant to give you a salary that may not be 
        competitive or in line with the reqs for the position.
        -turn around strategy...  that's a very good question. What salary range do you have budgeted?
        -or give a range..  be sure to know what range you need and what they pay.. 10kish. like 60 to 70k.
                            but becareful they will do the bare minimum like 60k or 61k.

    Prepare questions to ask the interviewer.
        -what are the jobs current challenges?
        -What specific skills or qualities are necessary to succeed in this job?
        -why is this position open? --see below
        -what are the most pressing objectives you would want to see addressed in the first 3 months.
        -(maybe) How do I compare to other candidates you've interviewed so far?
        -Where are you in the hiring process?   Not may I follow up in a week.
                give you a timeline of when to follow up.  Annette will ask. 

    West Coast is approaching Cincy developers and taking them, so there is a shortage.
        some are saying they would love to take on Max Grads but they need Mid Level developers.
        there is a shortage since they are being poached by west coast companies.

    One grad took a job and the senior developer left, so it was the max grad and college grad only.
    and the max grad was now the senior in the position and didnt know what to do.


    Debrief the Interview
    -what appearled to you most
    -how did you do in the interview
    -what do you need to add/modify/delete
    -Names of interviewers, receptionist, others
    -Any hesitations

    Some places have not hired someone who didnt follow up
