Typescript

    Typescript is a superset of JavaScript.  Everything JS can do Typescript can do and more.
    expands on JS.
    More like C# and/or Java.

    -Provides stronger type checking in development mode for:
        properties (variables)
        method params
        method return values
    -Is transpiled(compiled) into JavaScript
    -Plug-ins available for many programmer editors"

    Browsers dont know Typescript, so it includes software like a compiler.
        turning Typescript statements into JavaScript.. they call it Transpiling.

    Microsoft product to give advantages to javascript programmers that C# has.
    Visual Code is Microsoft, so its already built in.

        it is different than compiling because it never fails to produce
        JavaScript code. 
        -There could be errors in your typescript code, but will still get
            javascript out and will be errors there still too.

    Installing Typescript
        easily installed by NPM which is included with NodeJS

        NodeJS install the LTS version.
   
Install Typescript using NPM in BASH Shell:
    >npm install typescript -g
Create a folder on disk and CD into it
    >npm init -y


    Transpiling (compiling)
        -tsc.exe is the Typescript transpiler
        -turns a .ts into .js
        -Multiple options:
            -one file = tsc hi.ts -> hi.js
            -all files in folder = tsc *.ts -> *.js
        -tsconfig.json(in project root)
            -compilerOptions
                -outDir: "js"
            -include: ["ts/**.*"]
        -tsc -w    //transpile watch.

Examples:

Typescript                  JavaScript

let a: number = 0;          var a = 0;  --changes to var instead of let.

var b = 7;                  var b = 7;  --same, you can code in JS.

//these two are different, in JS its auto type based on what data it contains.
//in TypeScript a type is declared with p1: number, p2: number.

function Add(p1:            fucntion Add(p1, p2) {return p1 + p2;}
number, p2: number):
number {return p1 + p2;}


Typescriptlang.org (typescript.com redirects there)
    -> Playground.  And you can mess around with it.
        -> TS Config. Can change the version of JavaScript.
            we switched to earliest version and it changed let a to var a.

tsc --init

    to get the tsconfig.json.
    ->changed the target version to es2022

    -> uncommented outDir: "./js"  //tell it where our js is going.
    created js folder and ts folder.
    -> after first curly brace put "include": ["./ts/**.*"]
       tell it where our ts files go.

       this below; 

            /* Completeness */
            // "skipDefaultLibCheck": true,                      /* Skip type checking .d.ts files that are included with TypeScript. */
            "skipLibCheck": true                                 /* Skip type checking all .d.ts files. */
        },
        "include": ["./ts/**.*"]
        }


Created a new ts file hello-world.ts

            class HelloWorld {

                myName: string = "Josh";

                display(): void {
                    console.log(this.myName);
                }
            }

in terminal or git bash shell
    type tsc
and it will create the js file.


tsc -w 
    is a watch and it will transpile as we go.
ctrl c will stop the watch.



Open a new bash shell terminal in visual code by hitting the plus sign.

node ./js/hello-world.js  //--to run the js file.  It printed Josh.



Create Property names of a class
then constructor the same as before

then created a method to add a row of friend with properties defined.

create an array.. of the type Class Friend.
        let friends: Friend[] = [
            new Friend("Denise", "denise@maxtrain.com", "513-322-8888"),
            new Friend("Noah", "noah@maxtrain.com", "513-322-8888"),
            new Friend("Fred", "fred@maxtrain.com", "513-322-8888")
        ]


exporting
    -for an object to be used by another object, it must be exported.
    -Exported objects may be imported by other objects.
    -requires the export keyword preceding the class object.
    export class Customer {..}


in Angular have to add export for all our classes for the Capstone.
    export class Users, export class Vendors.

importing
    -to use an object defined in one file in another object, the object must be imported.
    -Class names are comma separated within curly brackets.
    -The file name is quoted and must be relative path from the file importing it.
        it never includes the ".ts"
        //import.. then class name and FROM keyword pointing to where that class file is.
        //again dont include the .ts for the "./aClass.ts" remove that .ts.
    import { classname } from "./aClass"

        -could put multiple class names with {classname, classname, classname}..


TypeScript allows generic classes with <>
    like List<>.



Install ANGULAR
        npm -g @angular/cli
        ng version  //to check the version number

    create project 
    ng new my-first-ng-app
        //should be all lowercase and dashes to separate words.
        //it will take a while downloading the files.

    open folder in visual code

    If you want add Bootstrap to src -> index.html for your app.
    src -> styles.css is global styes that will be available for entire application
    src ->app folder with 5 files.
            ->app.module.ts

            @sign things are decorators.
            export class at the bottom.

    spec.ts is for testing.  We got rid of it, no time for it in bootcamp.
    app.component.html has a bunch of garbage and says to delete template to start.
        we did ctrl a and backspace to get rid of it.

        -you can only put HTML that is in the <body> tags.
        -no head or script, etc.  only body stuff.

    app.component.css is only for the app component html, no others!

    In almost all cases you will only work with the app files or a subfolder.

Run And Debug..
    ng completion (if I want auto complete in the terminal) -I said N.

BINDING  
    in app.components.ts changed the title.
    in app.component.html added the title using 2 sets of curly braces.
        <h3>{{title}}</h3>

    this is a property of the AppComponent class.
        all we had to do was put the property and wrap in 2 curly braces

     
        called Binding --Binding the HTML to the data in the code.
            bound the property title to the h3 tags.

                previously we had to get programatic access to the data and then put it
                in the tags that have the id.
                but now we just bind it to the tags.



Angular vs AngularJS
    -Angular is all TypeScript and is v2.x. (version 14 now)
    -AngularJS is all javascript and was version 1.x.
    -Google decided to fundamentally change Angular from version 1 to version 2.
        -AngularJs was good for small self contained web applications.
        -not great for large applications with multiple pages. Unable to share components.

    AngularJS is mainly in the HTML page.
    Angular is mostly code / classes not in the HTML page.

Framework
    -Angular is an application framework written in Typescript for building responsive, 
    web application and Single page Applications. It provides all the tools and libraries
    needed. it has gained wide acceptance in the marketplace.
    -A framework is a toolset for producing application that require folloing a set of guidleines
    on how to use it.

     --cant do console apps or desktop apps with Angular.  Its web application only.
     --Framework has to be used by their rules, its not freewheeling. 
            example. the plugs in a room for electricity is a framework, set at 110v.
                cant plug in anything else, you are restricted.  Except an Oven or Dryer that has
                different plugs and their own source.

            learn how angular works to do things.
            like how controllers and models work together in capstone webapi.

    SPA -single page app. Angular is hard to beat as the best tool.

    Component-based framework
        -components are completely, self-contained units that control a portion of the web page.
        -components are organized into a tree-like structure with a root component and all other
            components branching form the root or from other components.
        
Structure of Angular App
        <Parent -> Child>
    Application - > Header, Menu, Financials, Footer.
        Application - > Financials -> Receivables, General Ledger, Payables
            Application - > Financials -> General Ledger -> Chart of Accounts, General Journal

Component Composition
    Import of other classes
    A single decorator
    And exported Class
    --Every component has a single parent.
    --app component is in the HTML <body> tags as <app-root></app-root>
            app component decorator has selector: 'app-root',

The application is a module
    -An Angular application is defined as a module
    -A module is a collection of other modules, components, pipes, services.
    -Every object used in the application must be known to the app module.
    -Modules are similar to:
        an EXE or DLL in .NET
        a JAR in Java


DONT Manually refresh the browser in middle of the Angular app. 
        it will restart it over again.

    SPA (Single Page Application)
    -Angular makes it easy to create a SPA
    -SPA has the following characteristics:
        --typically only a single HTML page with all the HTML tags common to every page
        --HTML fragments (views) that get injected into the HTML page based on the browser URL(router)
    -SPA tend to minimize network traffic to the server with much of the work done in JavaScript on the client.

        --instead of going back and forth to the server for additional pages. it could start running
        really slowly.  
        --SPA takes everything at one time and brings down to the client. Holds in the Cache.
                now the systems needs to be healthy.

Architecture of SPA
    --graphic on page 58 of the pdf powerpoint.
        on top = header and menu under header.
        left sidebar | content area | right sidebar
        Footer at the bottom.

        The content area in the middle changes depending on the page they are on.
        
        The other components are the same.  same header, same menu, same left & right sidebar 
        component, same footer component.

 

 CLI (Command Line Interface)
    -used to create projects and objects within those projects
    -can be git bash shell, windows cmd.exe, mac terminal
    
    -ng [command] [options] where command is required and options vary.
        >ng new my-first-angular-project

        -https://angular.io/
    
    -Node must be installed in order to install Angular/CLA
        >npm install -g @angular/cli
    
    Help
    >ng new --help

    or --routing. Generate a routing module for the project.

    Options are; 
        -routing: causes a routing module be generated within the project.
        -no test cases (--skip-tests): Does not generate the unit test files (*.spec.ts)

    Creating new objects(generate)
        >ng (g)enerate [blueprint] [name] [option]
        >ng generate component [name]

        Blueprints:  only need to type the letter in parens, then space.
            (cl)ass
            (c)omponent
            (g)uard
            (m)odule
            (p)ipe
            (s)ervice

    Generate Component
        >ng g c [name] [option]
        
        -most angular projects have many components and all must be defined to the app.module.
        -creates a new subfolder with component name
    
    Generate Module
        >ng generate module [name] [option]
        -a module is a grouping of components, services, pipes, and other modules.

    Generate Service
        >ng generate service [name] [option]
        -Generates a service and adds the decorator info to make it available throughout the app.
            
    --you could create a method in component b and want to use it in component a.
    cant do it, unless they are parent -> child component.  Otherwise they dont talk to each other.

    --But can do this as a Service.  One component can read or change a service in another component.
    --Services are created to be used by multiple components.

    -In capstone we are going to create a service that will make all the calls to the controllers.


    Build and Run project(serve)
        >ng serve [option]

        -Does a build and starts the project
        -(-o) opens the browser or tab and monitors the source files refreshing the browser after
            any save.
        -the default URL is http://localhost:4200

    
Structure of Angular files

    Importing classes
        import {UserListComponent} from './user-list/user-list-component.ts'

    Decorators
        -Decorators provide meta-data about the object
        -always begin with @ sign
        -defines the object type
        -most take parameters, but unused params need not be specified.
            --Decorators are not TypeScript so no ;
        @Component(..)
        export class {..}

        -take a JSON object as a parameter
        -NEVER add a semicolon at end of decorator!!!!!

        @Component({
            selector: "abc-comp", 
            templateUrl: "./abc.component.html",
            styleUrls: []
        })
        export class AbcComponent {... }
    

    Classes
        -All objects in Angular are classes
        -Classes must be exported using export.

        export class AbcComponent implements OnInit {
            counter; //property
            print() { } //method
            constructor() { } //constructor
            ngOnInit() {}  //life-cycle method
        }

        -will have ngOnInit in all of our classes.
        -Typescript differences from C# & Java
            -all objects are public by default
            -only one constructor allowed
            -must use this. 

Modules

    -Module is like a project in C#.  It has to know about everything in your application.
    -All UI objects must belong to a module
    -All applications have a root module
    -All modules marked with @NgModule decorator
        --with data:
            declarations: component class names
            imports: module class name
            exports: module/component class names
            providers: service class names
            bootstrap: startup component
        
        //all arrays of class names.  no quotes.
            @NgModule({
                declarations: [AppComponent],
                imports: [BrowserModule],
                providers: [],
                bootstrap: [AppComponent]
            })
            export class AppModule { }



Components  (Most important part)

    -Objects that render and manage data on the page
    -A typical component will contain:
        imports
        the @Component decorator
        a class
    -the html and css can be provided by:
        -pointing to a single file containing html or an array of files containing css
        -the html or css can be embedded in the file.


    @Component
        -an object is a component because it has @Component decorator
        -Options are:
            -selector: "app-comp",
            -template(html):
                templateUrl: "[html-file]"
                template:"[html]"
            -style (css)
                styleUrls: ["css-file", "css-file", ...]
                styles:["body {color:blue;}", "p{color:red;}",...]

Selectors
    -selector is an identifier for the component
    -selector is embedded in another components html as an HTML tag.
        <div>
            <span>Start of component</span>
            <app-comp></app-comp>
        </div>

    -the template/templateUrl is the only required decorator key
    -components that are only used in SPA routes may exclude a selector.

Template (html)
    -in Angular, template means HTML
    -template is typically used for only very small html

Styles (css)
    -styles in components are localized to only the component they are attached to.
    -Can be specified by:
        styleUrls: or styles: 

OnInit is an interface.
 returns ngOnInit(): void { }



Data Binding
    -In Angular, data is bound to html objects in either a one-way or two-way method.
    -In one-way binding, the modified property data value is immediately updated on the user
    interface, but changes to the user interface control does not cause a change in the property data.
    -In Two-way binding, any changes to either the property or the control cause a change in the other.

    If the data on your code changes -- change it on the user interface.
    one-way binding, if you want it to change.. change it in your code.

    if you have form control, like an input box or something the user interacts with..
        its two-way binding.  Once they interact it will change the variable.

    example:  
        let name: string = "MAX"
            One-Way Data Binding
                <p>{{name}}</p>
            
            Two-Way Binding (req FormsModule)
            <input [(ngModel)]="name" type="text>

            In both cases above, "name" is a property of the component.

********MUST ADD FormsModule to your AppModule. for Two-Way Binding**************



Name, Address, phone, email
